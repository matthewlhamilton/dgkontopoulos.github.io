### Abstract:

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
<b>Background</b><br>
The term 'molecular cartography' encompasses a family of computational 
methods for two-dimensional transformation of protein structures and 
analysis of their physicochemical properties. The underlying algorithms 
comprise multiple manual steps, whereas the few existing implementations 
typically restrict the user to a very limited set of molecular 
descriptors.<br><br>

<b>Results</b><br>
We present Structuprint, a free standalone software that fully 
automates the rendering of protein surface maps, given - at the very 
least - a directory with a PDB file and an amino acid property. The tool 
comes with a default database of 328 descriptors, which can be extended 
or substituted by user-provided ones. The core algorithm comprises the 
generation of a mould of the protein surface, which is subsequently 
converted to a sphere and mapped to two dimensions, using the Miller 
cylindrical projection. Structuprint is partly optimized for multicore 
computers, making the rendering of animations of entire molecular 
dynamics simulations feasible.<br><br>

<b>Conclusions</b><br>
Structuprint is an efficient application, implementing a molecular 
cartography algorithm for protein surfaces. According to the results of 
a benchmark, its memory requirements and execution time are reasonable, 
allowing it to run even on low-end personal computers. We believe that 
it will be of use - primarily but not exclusively - to structural 
biologists and computational biochemists.
