### Abstract:

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Protein structure is more conserved than sequence in nature. In this 
direction we developed a novel methodology that significantly improves 
conventional homology modelling when sequence identity is low, by taking 
into consideration 3D structural features of the template, such as size 
and shape. Herein, our new homology modelling approach was applied to the 
homology modelling of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of dengue 
(type II) virus. The RdRp of dengue was chosen due to the low sequence 
similarity shared between the dengue virus polymerase and the available 
templates, while purposely avoiding to use the actual X-ray structure 
that is available for the dengue RdRp. The novel approach takes advantage 
of 3D space corresponding to protein shape and size by creating a 3D 
scaffold of the template structure. The dengue polymerase model built 
by the novel approach exhibited all features of RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerases and was almost identical to the X-ray structure of the dengue 
RdRp, as opposed to the model built by conventional homology modelling. 
Therefore, we propose that the space-aided homology modelling approach 
can be of a more general use to homology modelling of enzymes sharing 
low sequence similarity with the template structures.
