My goals in research are to advance understanding of (1) how environmental policy outcomes reflect patterns of interactions within communities of policy actors, as well as (2) how environmental policy actors behave in response to different sets of constraints and opportunities that characterize policy arenas. I draw upon the Institutional Analysis and Development framework, the Ecology of Games framework and theories of network science to contribute to interdisciplinary fields such as collaborative environmental governance, social-ecological systems dynamics and sustainability science. Key methodological approaches include traditional econometric modeling, inferential network analysis and spatial analysis.

Temperature is a major driver of the performance of physiological 
and ecological traits (e.g., growth rate, escape body velocity) of all 
organisms, but especially of ectotherms. It is becoming increasingly clear 
that the shape of the thermal response curve (shown on the right) varies considerably 
across different traits, species, or thermal environments. I am interested 
in identifying processes that generate variation in the shape of the  
response, and factors that constrain it. Understanding 
these should improve our ability to predict the impacts of climate change 
on biological systems.
