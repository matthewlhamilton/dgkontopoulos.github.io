My goals in research are to advance understanding of (1) how environmental policy outcomes reflect patterns of interactions within communities of policy actors, as well as (2) how environmental policy actors behave in response to different sets of constraints and opportunities that characterize policy arenas. I draw upon the Institutional Analysis and Development framework, the Ecology of Games framework and theories of network science to contribute to interdisciplinary fields such as collaborative environmental governance, social-ecological systems dynamics and sustainability science. Key methodological approaches include traditional econometric modeling, inferential network analysis and spatial analysis.

<h2><b>Evolutionary thermal biology</b></h2>

<font size = "3">
Temperature is a major driver of the performance of physiological 
and ecological traits (e.g., growth rate, escape body velocity) of all 
organisms, but especially of ectotherms. It is becoming increasingly clear 
that the shape of the thermal response curve (shown on the right) varies considerably 
across different traits, species, or thermal environments. I am interested 
in identifying processes that generate variation in the shape of the  
response, and factors that constrain it. Understanding 
these should improve our ability to predict the impacts of climate change 
on biological systems.

How do different genes and gene products (co-)evolve during adaptation, 
especially to extreme environments? What can we deduce from the size of 
a gene family across multiple species? Which gene expression alterations 
allow an organism to respond to changes in its local environment? 
These are some of the questions that I am interested in answering using 
comparative genomic and molecular approaches.

<h2><b>Software development for computational biology</b></h2>
<div style = "display:flex; align-items:center;">

The breadth of available datasets (molecular, ecological, 
environmental, or others) continuously expands the range of
questions that we can address to understand the structure and 
functioning of biological systems. To facilitate answering such 
questions, I am particularly interested in 
developing new software tools, or combining pre-existing ones into pipelines.
