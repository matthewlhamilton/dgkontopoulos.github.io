<font size = "3.5">
I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Environment and Natural Resources at The Ohio State University, where I am also a faculty member of the [<span class="underline-on-hover" style="color:#FF6F6F">Sustainability Institute</span>](http://si.osu.edu). I do research on human-environment interactions in complex institutional settings, in which patterns of interactions among individual people, organizations, and decision-making processes influence the performance of environmental institutions, which in turn shape environmental outcomes. 
<br><br>

I explore questions such as: under what conditions can decision-making processes promote collaborative problem-solving at different administrative, spatial, and temporal scales? What factors shape the use of science in environmental decision-making? Under what conditions can biophysical connectivity (e.g., transmission of wildfire from one forested area to another) facilitate or impede collaborative interactions among resource users and other stakeholders? How can policy-makers constructively address conflict that stems from diverse perspectives on the factors that contribute to long-standing environmental governance challenges? 
<br><br>

In this work, I draw upon tools and perspectives from policy, psychological, and environmental sciences, and I collaborative extensively with colleagues from diverse social and natural science backgrounds. My research also involves partnerships with natural resource management practitioners, extensionists, and members of other environmental stakeholder groups.
