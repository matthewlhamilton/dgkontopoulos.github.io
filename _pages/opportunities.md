<h2><b>Prospective Graduate Students</b></h2>

I’ll be accepting 1-2 graduate students during this upcoming (2019) admissions cycle. If you are interested in working with me, please send me an email with:

1.	An overview of your research/professional experiences
2.	A detailed description of your research interests. Please be as specific as possible—your goals will certainly change over time, but the more details you can provide the better we can figure out if I might be a good fit for you. 
3.	Your current CV/resume
4.	GRE percentiles (if available)

I especially welcome inquiries from students who have already done some work “in the field” (e.g., in environmental consulting, international development). Likewise, students with a solid natural sciences background are especially encouraged to get in touch.
